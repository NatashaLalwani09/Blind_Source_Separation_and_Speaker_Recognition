# Blind Source Separation & Speaker Recognition

Classification of human expressions for Speaker Recognition Audio Dataset using ANN and CNN

## Guide

For our code, it's best if viewed or ran as Jupiter Notebook or Google Collab
Files to run- Blind Source Separation & Speaker Recognition.ipynb, it basically shows how we preprocessed the data, implemented ANN & CNN and trained the models, we implemented FastICA model as well to separate the audio which was created by combining audio of 8 different speakers.
